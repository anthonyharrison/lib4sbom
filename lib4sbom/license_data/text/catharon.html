         <p>
            This license applies to source files distributed by
            Catharon Productions, Inc. in several archive packages.

         <p>
            This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG

            inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware
            products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
