            FLOSS License Exception<br />

            =======================
         </var>
         <p>
            (Adapted from
            http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html)
         </p>

         <p>
            I want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software
            (&quot;FLOSS&quot;) applications to be able to use specified
            GPL-licensed RRDtool libraries (the &quot;Program&quot;) despite
            the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with
            version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the &quot;GPL&quot;).
         </p>

         <p>
            As a special exception to the terms and
            conditions of version 2.0 of the GPL:
         </p>

         <p>
            You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely
            from the Program and one or more works (each, a &quot;FLOSS Work&quot;)
            licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below, as long as:
         </p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 1.</var>
               You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and
               the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections
               of the Derivative Work which are not derived from
               the Program, and which can reasonably be considered
               independent and separate works in themselves,
            </li>
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 2.</var>
               all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are
               not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be
               considered independent and separate works in themselves,
            </li>
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 1.</var>
               are distributed subject to one of
               the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
            </li>
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 2.</var>
               the object code or executable form of those sections are
               accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable
               source code for those sections on the same medium
               and under the same FLOSS license as the corresponding
               object code or executable forms of those sections, and
            </li>
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 3.</var>
               any works which are aggregated with the Program or
               with a Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or
               distribution medium in accordance with the GPL, can
               reasonably be considered independent and separate
               works in themselves which are not derivatives of
               either the Program, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
            </li>
         
</ul>
         <p>
            If the above conditions are not met, then the
            Program may only be copied, modified, distributed
            or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL.
